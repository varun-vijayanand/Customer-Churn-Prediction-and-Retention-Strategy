# Customer Churn Prediction Analysis & Strategy Development

## Description
This repository contains an **in-depth analysis of customer churn** in a rewards or loyalty program context. The goal is to predict and understand customer churn, and propose strategies to mitigate churn and increase retention. More specifically, this repository contains an in-depth analysis of customer churn in a rewards or loyalty program context. The main objective is to predict and understand customer churn, or 'lapse' as it's referred to in this context. The analysis includes building and evaluating several machine learning models to predict which customers are likely to churn. The models also provide insights into the key factors that influence churn, which are used to propose strategies to mitigate churn and increase customer retention.

## Methodology
A systematic approach was followed for this analysis, including:
1. Data Exploratory Analysis
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
5. Model Training and Evaluation
6. Model Optimization (for the Logistic Regression model)
7. Model Selection and Comparisons
8. Feature Importance Analysis
